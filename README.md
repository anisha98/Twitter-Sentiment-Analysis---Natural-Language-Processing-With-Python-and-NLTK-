# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis---Natural-Language-Processing-With-Python-and-NLTK-

We run various classifiers: MultinomialNB, BernoulliNB, LogisticRegression, SGDClassifier, SVM(SVC, LinearSVC, NuSVC) to classify the live tweets on any input topic as good and bad tweets. 

We train our models on negative and positive texts. We find that BernoulliNB, LogisticRegression perform equally well.
